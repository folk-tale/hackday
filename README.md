# About Folktale
Most kids live away from their grandparents, aunts, and uncles. For preschoolers, especially, communicating with long-distance family members can be a challenge. Folktale is an app that helps these kids and their families connect through storytelling. With photos, avatars, and props, Folktale turns video calls into play sessions where adult and child rely on each other to go on imaginary adventures. In the process, the interacting avatars emphasize closeness, and the visual prompts scaffold the childâ€™s participation. In learner studies, adults and children played together for 20 to 50 minutes, creating a world together (though physically apart) through story.
